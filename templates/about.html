    <h1>About Style Transfer</h1>

    <p>
        Image style transfer is a subject that has been studied a lot in the past few years. 
        However, the existing models focus on transferring the whole image to a designated style. 
        While learning more about machine learning in AMLI, computer vision is one area that we havenâ€™t had enough chance to explore. 
        Style transfer is one subject that has the potential to be impactful and useful to a large audience. 
        With current deployment of some apps, one can apply artistic filters to the photos. We want to 
        create an web app that interactively offers more style transfer options to users.
